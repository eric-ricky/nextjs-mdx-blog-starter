Software developers and food are like peanut butter and jelly. You can't have one without the other!

<YouTube id="c6hryuTnfUA" />

When a developer is coding away, the last thing they want to do is take a break to make themselves a sandwich. That's why office snacks are a must-have for any software development team. Whether it's a bag of chips or a tray of cookies, developers need fuel to keep their brains running smoothly.

But it's not just about having something to munch on while coding. Developers also need a good meal to keep their energy levels up. That's why you'll often see them heading out for a team lunch or ordering in a bunch of pizzas.

So if you're a software developer, make sure you keep your pantry stocked with snacks and your schedule open for those all-important food breaks. Your code will thank you!
